EColiCore2 was obtained from Hadicke, O., Klamt, S.: EColiCore2 : a reference network model of thecentral metabolism of Escherichia coli and relationships to itsgenome-scale parent model (doi:10.1038/srep39647)

Besides this version (EColiCore2.xml) we provide a version (EColiCore2_bounds.xml) that includes additional boundaries on GlcUP, ATPM and O2Up but with all other carbon uptake reactions (as well as the resulting orphaned metabolites) removed.
